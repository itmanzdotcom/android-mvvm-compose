# Tech stack & Open-source libraries
- Minimum SDK level 24
- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) is Android’s modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android. Quickly bring your app to life with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) based, [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) + [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/) for asynchronous.
- [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for dependency injection.
- Jetpack
    - Lifecycle - Observe Android lifecycles and handle UI states upon the lifecycle changes.
    - ViewModel - Manages UI-related data holder and lifecycle aware. Allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
    - ViewBinding - Is a feature that allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views. Once view binding is enabled in a module, it generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module. An instance of a binding class contains direct references to all views that have an ID in the corresponding layout.
    - Room Persistence - Constructs Database by providing an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access.
- Architecture
    - MVVM Architecture (Model - View - ViewModel)
    - [Repository Pattern](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-training-repository-pattern#0)
- [Retrofit2 & OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/retrofit) - Construct the REST APIs.
- [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) - Moshi is a modern JSON library for Android, Java and Kotlin.
- [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) - An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines.
- [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) - A logger with a small, extensible API.
- [Material3](https://m3.material.io/develop/android/jetpack-compose) - Material 3 is the latest version of Google’s open-source design system. Design and build beautiful, usable products with Material 3.
- [Baseline Profiles](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/baselineprofiles/overview) - Baseline Profiles improve code execution speed by around 30% from the first launch.
